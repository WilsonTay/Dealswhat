Restrictions on Distribution and Copying.
Unless expressly authorized in writing by Widen, Fine Uploader Software provided by
Widen under this SSA may not be distributed to any other person or entity, and any such

Term and Termination.
The term of this SSA shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a
period of twelve (12) months unless terminated earlier as set forth herein (the “ Term ”).
This SSA shall terminate at the end of the Term except for such
provisions that may be indicated herein as surviving termination of this SSA. Either
Party may terminate this SSA and the License granted hereunder upon written notice for
any material breach of this SSA, including failure to pay undisputed Fees when and as
due. In the event of termination of this SSA for any cause, all rights granted hereunder
automatically revert to the granting Party.

If a Party breaches any of the terms of this SSA and fails to cure such breach within
fifteen (15) days of written notification of such breach (the “ Cure Period ”),
the non-breaching Party giving such notice shall have the right, without prejudice to any other
rights it may have, so long as the breach remains uncured, to terminate this SSA,
effective upon giving written notice to the breaching Party. This SSA may also be
terminated immediately by a Party upon the other Party’s bankruptcy, liquidation,
judicial management, receivership, act of insolvency or change in control.

Fees and Limits.
The fee for Fine Uploader Software and Fine Uploader Support is an annual charge that
includes all Releases and Patches within the Term (“ Fees ”). The Fees and

Costs and Expenses.
Except as expressly provided in this SSA, each Party shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses incurred by that Party in performing its obligations or exercising its rights under
this SSA.

Payment Terms.
The Fees must be paid in U.S. Dollars. Customer authorizes Widen to bill Customer’s
credit card for the Fees for items specified at www.fineuploader.com. Any and all
payments made by Customer pursuant to this SSA are non-refundable unless otherwise
specified. If Customer fails to fulfill its payment obligations for undisputed Fees as

Taxes arising from or relating to this SSA that are paid by or are payable by Widen
including, without limitation, sales, service, use, or value added taxes. If Customer is
required under any applicable law or regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or
deduct any portion of the payments due to Widen, then the sum payable to Widen shall
be increased by the amount necessary so that Widen receives an amount equal to the sum
it would have received had Customer made no withholdings or deductions. Customers
with a tax-exempt status shall provide to Widen documentation of such status sufficient
for Widen and Customer to avoid liability for qualifying Taxes.
